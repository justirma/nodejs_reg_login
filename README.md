## [Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FOq4cUdH8k) started 5/12 on using Nodejs and Passport for Login

### 5/12 - Left off on Reg portion (27:24)

Learnings:

- Bringing in Node
- Creating MongoDB
- Creating views (EJS)
- Using Bootstrap and FontAwesome for styling
- Setting up the routes (/user, /registration, /login)

### 5/13 Up and Running!

Learnings:

- Created a user
- Setup validation for Register and Login
- Validation pass
- Created new user instance
- Ran into an ejslint error that pointed to register.js having an extra closing bracket :(
- Initialized PassportJS
- Handled login
- Handled logout
- Handled authentication via `auth.js` so that a logged out user cannot view dashboard
- Learned a bit more about using partials

### How will I use this in the future?

Will most likely use this a boilerplate to start on other web apps I create. Once I get more comfortable I'll explore other tools to make auth and login more seamless.
